# Modbus Data Logger

## Description

This is a project for a DIN rail Modbus Data Logger. The idea was to record the energy production of a photo voltaic installation using a data logger that also works offline. The data logger will read values off the energy counter at regular intervals. The values are then stored with a time stamp on an SD card. The log files can later be retrieved via a WiFi access point.
